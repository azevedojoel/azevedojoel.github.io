Creating something is all about problem-solving. <br/>-Philip Seymour Hoffman
</p>
First and foremost I consider myself a problem solver. I have used a number of technologies along the way to help solve some of these interesting problems.

## Summary
I have a very strong understanding of object-oriented programming, patterns and practices, and have worked extensively with the entire Microsoft Stack to successfully deliver large-scale and small products. I am a passionate developer with a strong desire to grow and build on the last 16 years designing and implementing enterprise applications including a multi-tiered web/windows package for an international pharmaceutical company, a job listing management application for a local university, an ASP.NET MVC Case Management system with Windows Workflow Foundation, and numerous other projects. I have experience as both a developer and a team leader and I am comfortable in both positions. I work well with non-technical clients in gathering requirements, creating User Stories and Use Cases, to understand their needs and deliver a product that is successful.
