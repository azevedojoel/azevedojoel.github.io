   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;The beginning is the most important part of the work.
&lt;br/&gt;-Plato
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m creating a blog in Jekyll on a MacBook Pro. I did not think 8 months ago that I would enjoy working on a Mac...ever. But what do you know, I like the Mac. I also like my Windows 10 box. I even installed Ubuntu in a VM a few weeks ago but that one has not lasted, I haven&amp;#39;t logged into it since the first day. I like technology and I like learning. I can&amp;#39;t imagine anyone being in this field of software development and not consider themselves a lifetime learner. I am not a genius by any stretch of the imagination but I enjoy sitting down and approaching problems from many different view points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my poor writing skills and extreme perfectionism I cannot image this blog will see too much attention but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
