title: Hybrid App Development
excerpt: I do not have as much experience in mobile development as I would like. Although I am very comfortable with responsive design using JS and CSS I want to dive deeper into mobile development. Since getting my MacBook I’ve spent a little time in Xcode and doing a couple of ‘hello world’ things and playing with Swift but nothing too serious. I’ve heard Ionic and Cordova mentioned a few times lately and so I’m going to take a look. I’ll probably continue to learn some of the native Swift/Objective-C/Java features, but given how much fun Javascript has been lately going with a hybrid solution just seems good.

I do not have as much experience in mobile development as I would like. Although I am very comfortable with responsive design using JS and CSS I want to dive deeper into mobile development. Since getting my MacBook I’ve spent a little time in Xcode and doing a couple of ‘hello world’ things and playing with Swift but nothing too serious. I’ve heard Ionic and Cordova mentioned a few times lately and so I’m going to take a look.

#What is Cordova?
Cordova exposes many of the native device features through Javascript APIs.
>[Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.0.0/guide_overview_index.md.html#Overview) is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

#Getting Cordova
To install Cordova all you need to have is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo npm install -g cordova
{% endhighlight %}

#Create the App
{% highlight bash %}
$ cordova create iterative com.iterative.hello HelloWorld
{% endhighlight %}

This will generate the skeleton project in a directory called iterative. The second and third arguments are optional. The second argument is an identifier and the third is the applications display title.

#Add the iOS platform
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd iterative #make sure you are in the directory
$ cordova platform add ios
{% endhighlight %}

You could also do android, windows8, etc...
{% highlight bash %}
$ cordova platform add amazon-fireos
$ cordova platform add android
$ cordova platform add blackberry10
$ cordova platform add firefoxos
{% endhighlight %}

Looks like the iOS folder is created with all of the necessary setup files.

This is the project opened in Xcode. The www directory contains the stuff I am most curious about: the HTML/CSS/JS. I’m going to go ahead a make a couple of small changes: replace logo.png with my own and put in some different text. Small changes but just to see if it picks them up.

#Build the App
{% highlight bash %}
$ cordova build
{% endhighlight %}

This will compile everything from the www directory to the specific platform. If I make any changes to the www files, as I did, you just need to run this again to compile it down the platform specific folders.
Now I can either jump back into Xcode and click Run or do this
{% highlight bash %}
$ cordova emulate
{% endhighlight %}

And here is my new Cordova App running in the iOS simulator.

It is surprisingly simple to get up and running with Cordova. Just getting this far in such a short amount of time has made me far less intimidated with rich mobile development. I'm looking forward to Ionic!
